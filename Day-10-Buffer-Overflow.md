# Day 10 - Buffer Overflow

## What It Is
A Buffer Overflow happens when a program writes more data into a buffer (a fixed size memory block) than it was designed to hold. The extra data spills over into adjacent memory, corrupting it. Attackers exploit this to overwrite critical memory regions — like the return address — and redirect program execution to their own malicious code. It's a memory corruption vulnerability at the lowest level of how programs run.
